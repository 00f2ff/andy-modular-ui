This is a mockup of the second iteration of our interface design. 

Run 'index3.html'

Works best when in full screen (F11 on Windows)

Click and drag menu items onto any quadrant. The color change is a stand-in for information transfer, i.e. dragging a UI bundle to a quadrant will fill the quadrant with the data pertaining to that UI.

<!-- Click and drag handles in between quadrants to resize bundles. Pulling a handle will turn a quadrant into a half and effectively eliminiate the overwritten quadrant. Pulling it back with reverse the effect. Pulling a half into another half or quadrant will turn it into a whole. -->

Click the bundle navigation to change how the content is laid out on the screen.
